# Week 1 homework 

Your homework assignment for this week is to draw a scene to the canavas using primitive shapes we learned in class. 
 
## Basic (required)
1. Pseudocode your scene. Remember our drawing order here (bottom gets drawn last)! 
2. Code your scene using at minimum 3 different shapes (see the processing API for inspiration)
3. Print the position of a shape to the console
4. Use variables to modify your scene. (can either save this in another sketch or uncomment the code in a single sketch)
5. Position your shapes in proportion to the width and height of your canvas 
5. Upload your sketch to gist and post on the class wiki! 

## Challenges (not required but good to at least try!)
1. Use a math function to position your shape randomly on the screen
2. Dynamically change the color of your scene using a ++ or -- operator 
3. Use a keyboard or mouse input (see processing api) to change the color or position of a shape in your scene
