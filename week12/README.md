### Week 12! 

Next week we'll be learning a few libraries for half of the class and taking the in class 
Final assessment for half of the class. 

## in class assignments: 
 
Physics
Create 3 separate ellipses:
1. that stands still 
2. ...moves at the same velocity in the x direction 
3. ...and accelerates in the x direction 

Class 
1. create an array of objects that move to the edge of the screen and get re-positioned to 0
when they hit the edge of the screen 

Sin & Cos 
1. create a pendulum (optional)
2. create an ellipse that moves in a wave and orbits around a larger ellipse (hint use a transform)

Array lists: 
1. Make a sketch that adds a bouncing ball every 30 frames 
2. Remove a bouncing ball when it's clicked on 



## Review the following topics: 
1. Classes –– data, methods, constructors, declaring instances, creating an array of instances
2. Vector –– how to use vector for physics, postion, speed, and acceleration
3. Sin & Cos –– how to use sin & cos to create orbits and waves 
4. Arraylist –– declaring, adding and removing items from an array list 
5. If you didn't finish the in-class examples, try on your own and review the solutions in our class repos
