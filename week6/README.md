# Week 6 Homework 

Array week! Arrays are a great way to store variables and access that data efficiently. We also reviewed how to use for loops in order to assign and access variables in our arrays. 

## Basic (required)
1. Create an array of strings. 
2. Use probability to display text from your string array 
3. Create an array to store the position of multiple shapes (5+)
4. Assign values to your position array using a for loop 
5. Complete midterm practice assignment 

## Challenge 
1. Create collision in the bouncing ball sketch we created in class 
2. Freeze the movement of an ellipse if you click on it 
3. Extra extra challenge, toggle the movement back on if you click on the ellipse again 
(hint, you'll need a boolean array)
