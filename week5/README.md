# Week 5 Homework

It's loop week! For this week you will have to read one chapter (of your choice) of [10print](http://nickm.com/trope_tank/10_PRINT_121114.pdf)

## Required
1. Replicate a pattern from the 10 print chapter you read 
2. Create a single loop
	a. Change the size of an ellipse based on it's position in the loop (i.e. ellipses get smaller or larger)
3. Create a nested loop
	a. Use the map function in the loop (differently than the way we used it in class!)
4. Use your mouse position to create a dynamic loop 
5. Midterm practice question 

## Challenge
1. Use nested loops to create a checker board pattern 
2. Use a tripple nested for loop to create a grid in a 3d space
